\newglossaryentry{amphiphilic}{
    name={Amphiphilic},
    description={Refers to a molecule or material that possesses both hydrophilic (water-attracting) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) components, enabling it to interact with both aqueous and oily environments. This property is essential in applications such as emulsions, detergents, and biological membranes}
}

\newglossaryentry{hydrophobicity_score}{
    name={Hydrophobicity Score},
    description={The measure of how hydrophobic (water-repelling) an amino acid is, based on a specific scale such as the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale}. It is a moving average of the 19 contiguos ($\pm$ 9) residues
}

\newglossaryentry{betaBarrel}{
    name={Beta Barrel},
    description={A structural motif in proteins consisting of a large beta-sheet that twists and coils to form a closed, cylindrical shape. It is commonly found in porins, lipocalins, and other membrane-spanning or binding proteins}
}


\newglossaryentry{tritonX100}{
    name={Triton X-100},
    description={A non-ionic surfactant commonly used in laboratories for solubilizing membrane proteins and disrupting lipid bilayers}
}

\newglossaryentry{sds}{
    name={SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)},
    description={An anionic detergent widely used in protein denaturation and electrophoresis, known for its ability to disrupt non-covalent bonds in proteins}
}

\newglossaryentry{softSolubilization}{
    name={Soft Solubilization},
    description={A gentle method of solubilizing membrane proteins or other biomolecules using mild detergents to preserve their native structure and function}
}
